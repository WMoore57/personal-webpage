<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  
  I am a student at Concordia University, NE studying Business Education. I also compete on the shooting sports team. Some of my hobbies include sports (a wide variety), hunting/shooting, watching movies, and just hanging out with friends. My top two sports are football and wrestling as I love watching and competing in them, I love hunting deer, and my favorite movies are thrillers. I am including a picture of what trapshooting (one of many shooting sports events) so you can get an idea of what it loolks like!
